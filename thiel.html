            <div class="story-content">
                Competition is really bad for businesses. It generally means you have incrementally improved an existing product, rather than innovated and created something new.

                Best founders are definite optimists. They believe the future will be brighter and it is a certain future without a lottery ticket. They have a worldview that society will look a certain way in 10-20 years and they are building around that.
            </div>

            <div class="story-content">
                Indefinite optimists believe that the future is unknown and unknowable. Pessimists believe the future will not be better.

        <h3>Gaining Traction</h3>

        <div class="story-item">
            <div class="story-number">4.</div>
            <div class="story-content">
                Start with a really small piece of the market and then slowly expand to different parts of the market. You have to continuously attempt to create monopolies at all points of the business and capture that market incredibly quickly.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="story-item">

                PayPal started with emigrant offices and E-bay power users. Tesla started with Sedan Electric Sports cars then Luxury Sportscars. Amazon started with books. Uber started with cars at the SF airport. Facebook started with Harvard college campus.

        <h3>Team Culture</h3>

        <div class="story-item">
            <div class="story-number">6.</div>
            <div class="story-content">
                Founders no more than $100k salary. Need employees motivated by the long-term vision of the company with incentives aligned to creating long-term value.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="story-item">
            <div class="story-number">7.</div>
            <div class="story-content">
                Good team culture borders on cult-like. Except they are right, not wrong, about something extremely important. You should pay 2-3x above market rate for good talent. It is rare and hard to come by. You need them more than they need you.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="story-item">
            <div class="story-number">8.</div>
            <div class="story-content">
                Every startup tells employees they're solving a hard problem, they have a great team, and they can get paid in equity. Great employees want a mission they believe in whole-heartedly and a team that resonates with them.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="story-item">

            <div class="story-content">
                PayPal only hired people interested in replacing the US dollar and people obsessed with Sci-Fi. Need really lean and tight teams. Everyone is accountable for one thing means there is no competition.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="story-item">
            <div class="story-number">10.</div>
            <div class="story-content">
                Early at PayPal, really small and tight-knit teams did more. Too many employees creates bloat and not enough for everyone to do and accomplish. The best hires in startups do not respond to tonnes of perks because they could get more in management consulting or Google.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Distribution</h3>

            <div class="story-content">
                Only metric that matters is CAC: LTV/LTGP. If the product is less than $10K, you cannot do individual selling and you must have self-serve mechanism. This needs to be minimum 5:1 ratio for LTV and 3:1 Ratio for LTGP.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="story-item">

            <div class="story-content">
                Enterprise Sales ($50k to $1m): Need sales reps or typically the CEO initially travelling and meeting other Enterprise CEOs. Alex Karp spent 25/30 days travelling to sell Palantir initially. Each deal takes precision and class.

                Inherent Virality Marketing ($10-100 range): Cannot afford to pay for marketing so rely on viral trends and growth marketing. Common tactics include referral incentives, organic content (socials, SEO).
            </div>

                Superpower relied on organic content but most impressions came from Max. 2/3 of his audience was from Australia, so did not help attributable revenue. Paid ads were unprofitable for $1000 item.

                Timing is extremely important. The only real monopoly created in clean-tech was Tesla. They understood the secret that clean-tech was a social phenomenon, as much as an environmental phenomenon.

            <div class="story-content">
                A problem itself does not create a durable business. People tried to frame clean-tech as a trillion dollar industry, but they were positioning themselves as if they were a monopoly in a $10BN industry.
