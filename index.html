            <strong>my life in 7 sentences:</strong><br><br>
            0. watched <em>Rocky Balboa</em> when I was 6 years old & <em>Creed I</em> is my favourite film of all time. Watched it in NYC when I was 9 years old. Learnt to do hand-wraps when I was 8, but never boxed. Glad in hindsight. But, a rocky film was on my to-do list every Sunday.<br>
            1. Wanted to make the NRL from 5 yo – 14 yo. Played Junior Roosters with some guys playing for the Waratahs at the moment. Didn't go Gym. Failed<br>
            2. Became a Journalist for company with 30k members at age 14.<br>
            3. Made 43 Youtube Videos at age 15. Highest one got 1k views. Was a breakup video. Loved GoPros since I was a kid. Bought one at 6yo. Stole $100 from my parents to buy it at Harvey Norman (got caught).<br>
            4. 99.90 ATAR. Played pre-determined status games. Lost a good 6–9 months of my life to learn self-discipline & rote memorisation.<br>
            5. Worked in SF@Superpower. Didn't know what SAAS, VC, EBITDA was before this (still didn't know about EBITDA after ;)<br>
            6. Ran Website Agency to $1M ARR in 6 months. Considered dedicating my life to a mini-PE cashflow business. Become enraptured with the idea of becoming a billionaire.<br>
            7. Learning to program ....
