        <h1>Hi, I'm Tommy</h1>
        <h2>my story (in a romanticized way):</h2>
        <ol class="bio-list">
            <li> Watched <em>Rocky Balboa</em> when I was 6 years old. Motivated me to learn hand-wraps at 8. <bold>Creed I</bold> is my favourite film of all time. Watched it in NYC when I was 9.</li>
            <li> Wanted to make the NRL from 5–14. Played Junior Roosters with some guys currently playing for the Waratahs. Sports is very zero-sum. Therefore, it cultivates competitiveness. Maybe I should've tried to be Isaah Yeo. My wife will probs think it's more masculine than a tech biz.   </li>
            <li> Loved Reading & Writing. Became Journalist for a company at age 14. Read classics like Picture of Dorian Grey & non-fiction like Why We Sleep & Sapiens. </li>
            <li> Loved Filmmaking. Made 43 YouTube videos at age 15-16. Highest got 1k views — a breakup video. Loved GoPros since I was a kid. Bought one at 6yo & 10yo. Stole $100 from my parents to buy it at Harvey Norman (got caught).</li>
            <li> 99.90 ATAR at age 17. Played the pre-determined status game. Unintentionally dedicated 6–9 months to self-discipline & rote memorisation.</li>
            <li> Worked in SF @ Superpower. Didn't know what SAAS, VC, or EBITDA was before — still didn’t know what EBITDA was after ;)</li>
            <li> Ran Marketing Agency to $1M run-rate in 6 months (technically not quite $1m — but it sounds nice). Learnt about service-businesses: sales & marketing. Listened to 60 Mozi pods in 3 months. Considered a mini-PE empire of Mozi businesses (execution-based). Was enamoured with idea of being a billionaire.</li>
            <li> Learning to program ...</li>
        </ol>
