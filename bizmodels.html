                <div class="highlight">
                    <strong>Hormozi's View:</strong> Divested from solar business, cashflow business, with no enterprise value because no recurring revenue within the business. Can takeover staff, but no built-in revenue.
                </div>
                <div class="content">Energy Maestro thesis: nation-wide solar companies don't really work because the local guy wins. The guy that people know & know is only one call away wins. They looked at doing roll-ups, acquiring other solar businesses but ultimately opted not to do it. Economics didn't make sense.</div>
                <div class="strategy">Counter-argument: You could always create licensing model with chains in local towns & advertise to them. There are solar companies doing $300-400M in USA as well.</div>
            </div>

        <div class="business">
            <div class="business-title">Ecom Supplements Company</div>
            
            <div class="section">
                <div class="section-title">Background</div>
                <div class="content">Started 5 years ago. Charlie (founder) has experience doing biochemistry degree at Uni & then running creative agency. They wanted to build a supplement company using those marketing skills.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <div class="section-title">Distribution Strategy</div>
                <div class="strategy">Found large-distribution retailers as first acquisition methods. Coles, Woolworths & recently closed Priceline as first Pharmacy deal.</div>
                <div class="content">Since, they tinkered with Meta & had poor results. Have done content which doesn't drive much. Expanded to retail distributors in Vietnam & South-East Asia. Think they could be predominant supplement store in APAC.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <div class="section-title">Product Focus</div>

                <div class="content">All of these already existed & were copied from the US. Mainly target millennial females, not dudes. All marketing is done by female. Female mainly buy fancy supplements like collagen, sleep. No masculine supplements like creatine, protein powder.</div>

                <div class="section-title">Major Challenges</div>
                <div class="challenges">
                    <strong>Cash Flow Issues:</strong> Pay manufacturing company upfront. Wait 6 months for them to be made. Coles/Woolworths pay them 6 months later. So, they theoretically could be profitable. But, this means they have to dilute equity, raise debt to grow because payback mechanism is bad.
                </div>
                <div class="challenges">
                    <strong>Lost Distribution:</strong> Lost Coles as major distribution partner. Had 3rd party vendor handling the arrangement. They didn't control it. So, they lost it.
                </div>
                <div class="challenges">
                    <strong>No Customer Data:</strong> Don't get any data from coles/woolworths around who the customer is, demographics, wealth, gender, age etc. So, have no idea how to position the brand.

                <div class="strategy">$100M Offer. Don't get paid until they got results. Resulted in extremely high churn at the beginning. No cleaners got great results, so they churned.</div>
