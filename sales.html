        <h1>General Sales Principles</h1>
        
        <h2>Script for Rev-ops Service</h2>
        
        <h3>Purpose of document:</h3>

            <li>Cold-Calls + Cold-Emails. Marketing channel, not just a sales channel.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>General Structure of Calls:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Business Rapport — Personal to that prospect (typically LinkedIn research)</li>
            <li>Three Point Agenda</li>

            <li>Overviewing Past Attempts to solve this & more importantly what they have done to adapt to new way of AI Sales</li>
            <li>How we might be able to help — Could tie into Lead Magnet for that individual person initially</li>
            <li>Next Steps — Book a 2nd call to run them through the process.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Word for Word Memorisation:</h3>
        <p><strong>DO NOT READ LIKE A ROBOT … Pause & Speak Slowly</strong></p>
        
        <div class="script-section">
            <p><strong>Opening:</strong> Hey {{first_name}}, How have you been? Noticed XYZ on your LinkedIn. Mind telling me a little bit more about that?</p>
            
            <p><strong>Agenda:</strong> Perfect, I appreciate you jumping on. The purpose of today's call is to learn a little bit about each other & see if we could be a fit. Totally understand we may not be one & that's perfectly fine.</p>
            
            <p>Thought we could do three things 1) I can share what we're seeing in the space at the moment & particularly how it pertains to developing pipeline & see if any of those challenges are relevant 2) Would love if you share what you're noticing that has/hasn't been working 3) Leave 5 minutes for next steps, if there any. Does that sound okay?</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>POV:</h3>
        <p>Would you mind if I share a few things we're noticing in the space?</p>
        
        <p>Cool, so overall we're noticing sales is really tough at the moment.</p>
        
        <div class="script-section">
            <p><strong>Firstly, pipeline creation is harder than ever</strong>. In fact, the EBSTA research shows it's 73% harder to create pipeline than 3 years ago. Inboxes are flooded. There's very little differentiation in products/services. It's hard to cut through the noise.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Secondly, win rates have gone down</strong>. It means sales people need 3x more pipeline coverage. But, we know it's harder to build pipeline in the first place.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Thirdly, sales leaders are expected to do more with less.</strong> Less budget. Less Resources. Less Headcount. to reach the same growth targets as they have had to before.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Given that that's what going, Sales Leaders are asking three common questions being asked.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>How do we get reps spending more time selling?</li>
            <li>How do we get reps reaching the right people?</li>
            <li>How do we efficiently gives reps the right data?</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>And as such, it is both harder to get people into sales meetings & because close rates are down, it means you have to generate more pipeline in the first place. Again, not sure if you're experiencing any of this & this is just what i've heard from some of our clients. Curious, if you're noticing any of this?</p>
        
        <h3>Follow-Up Questions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Process PAIN—</strong> Can you walk me through your process to create pipeline?</li>
            <li><strong>Business PAIN —</strong> Given what I said before & what you're seeing, what are you finding the biggest issues with this process?</li>
            <li><strong>ROOT CAUSE —</strong> Mind if I ask, why do you think is happening?</li>
            <li><strong>Business PAIN</strong> This could be a bit too early, but what sort of knock-on effects is that having on Quota Attainment/Pipeline Generation?</li>
            <li><strong>OVERVIEW PAST PAIN —</strong> This seems like more of a current issue, how did you used to build pipeline?</li>
            <li><strong>POKE BEAR —</strong> Given how big the shifts have been, really curious to hear what you've been doing to stay ahead?
                <ul><li>Have you thought about personalising at scale?</li></ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

                <td>Struggling to target the right prospects efficiently on search platforms. High cost-per-click (CPC) with inconsistent lead quality. Time wasted on manual keyword adjustments and unoptimized campaigns. Difficulty tracking conversions and proving ROI to stakeholders.</td>
                <td>Not generating enough enrollment leads to hit growth targets. Losing prospective students to competitors with better ad visibility. High customer acquisition costs (CAC) erode profitability. Missed opportunities from unqualified or low-intent traffic.</td>
                <td>Instead of scattered targeting, we use data-driven keyword strategies to reach high-intent prospects (e.g., "RTO courses near me"), delivering meeting-ready leads. Instead of guesswork, we optimize bids and ad copy in real-time, slashing CAC and boosting conversions. Instead of manual tweaks, our tech stack automates campaign adjustments, freeing your team to focus on enrollments. Instead of vague results, we provide clear ROI reporting—e.g., "20 enrollments at $150 CPA"—to win stakeholder trust.</td>

                <td>Pipeline lacks volume—missing out on unaware prospects. Lower conversion rates from cold audiences not yet engaged. Wasting budget on broad campaigns with no clear funnel. Competitors dominate social feeds, stealing market share.</td>
                <td>Instead of sporadic reach, we craft precise audience segments (e.g., "parents of teens") and engaging video ads, building a steady lead pipeline. Instead of stale creatives, we test and refresh 3-5 ad variants monthly, keeping engagement high. Instead of lost leads, we implement retargeting flows (e.g., "Download Our Course Guide") to nurture prospects into enrollments. Instead of complexity, our streamlined management maximizes your budget across Facebook and Instagram, outpacing competitors.</td>

            <p>Hey {{firstname}} — I saw how you help people {{mission of what they do}} and wanted to reach out.</p>
            <p>Mind if I ask, a lot of {{industry}} companies have said that lead flow slows down more than they'd like. Same for {{company_name}}?</p>
            <p>The reason I ask is we've helped 10+ other {{industry}} clients generate leads on a performance basis.</p>
            <p>Can I send across a 2 minute video to explain?</p>

        <p><strong>Test 4:</strong> I put together a free landing page that would help boost conversion. Mind if I share it?</p>

        <p><strong>Test 8:</strong> If I could help setup a PPC system without any ongoing retainers, would it be worth having a yarn?</p>

        <div class="email-template">
            <p>Hey {{first_name}} – was on your builtwith and saw your website is integrated with Hubspot.</p>
            <p>I'm guessing you use it for the workflows to nurture leads along the buying journey? It helps retarget leads over long periods of time.</p>
            <p>The reason I ask is we're helping companies like Australian Vocational Academy increase MQLs in 2 months without a retainer or contract. Just based on performance!</p>
            <p>Would this be something you're looking to solve as well?</p>
