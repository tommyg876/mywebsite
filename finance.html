  **Intro**

My grandfather was a chartered accountant. He was laid off. My other grandfather worked in a bank. He was laid off. My father was COO at PWC. He was investigated by the ATO. My only successful uncle was a charted accountant. A family full of finance bros & CA degrees. Nice!

It seems like a lot of moderately high iq people go into finance. Not high, high-iq people because they genreally find it fairly boring. But probably one tier below that. I began wondering why that was, so did a decent amount of research into the different strands of it, how it impacts the world

This essay will cover 2 things:
(1) an outsider’s perception on the different roles in finance & the companies that are built as a result of that. Genreally this includes the actual role itself, career progression, salary, what you actually do on the job, genreally benefits & critiques of the job & it’s utility for society
(2) Why so many people do it, Why they shouldn’t do it & Who should actually do it

### Jobs

**Big 4/CFO/In-House:**

The dorks. Chartered Accountants. KPMG/Deloitte/PWC/EY. Typically your ~105 IQ grad roles except for Jono Lai. These people are typically either less intelligent or less conscientious than people that go into IB or Management consulting. You don’t have to have gotten overly great marks, you get $40-50k lower salary. The Big 4 was probably once prestigious, but seems to be getting less so the more time passes by.

Typically, career progression looks like: analyst for a couple yrs → senior analyst for a couple yrs → senior consultant for a few yrs → managerial roles for a few years, then ultimately you become director & then partner in your mid 30s. Honestly, there are so many layers of management, there’s no point trying to abstract them. But it’s the typical: partners are the rainmakers & own all the deals, directors assist them in their deals, managers are project managers like Hurl was and your juniors do all the modelling, excel work = GPT-type stuff. A lot of people around the senior analyst mark will do some external qualification (because a lot of other people do them); they’ll do a CFA (30% pass rate), or CA (~50% pass rate) or a CPA.

Honestly, I don’t have much to say about this category. It seems like quite a low IQ, low-ambition option. My dad stayed for 25 years, earned $200-400k until age 35ish. Then, earned $1-2M for 10 years, and then $2-5M for 10 years. After tax, he bought a $2.7m Bronte home + $1M renovation, $3M Woollahra home + $500k renovation, spent $1M on holidays when we were younger ($100k 6-7 times), my mum didn’t have to work, spent $600k post-tax on our school fees all up & $100k/yr on our living expenses. It’s a decent, even good life. Most of his gains are the fact that Woollahra property would be worth $8M and Bronte would be worth $10M. Maybe he should’ve been a property investor instead. We

But ultimately, if you want to earn proper coin as a finance bro, you go into Investment Banking or Private
